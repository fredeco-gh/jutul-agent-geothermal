"""Serve jutul-agent's chat UI with the geothermal map capability wired in.

This is the integration point for the native-canvas-panel architecture
described in docs/web-ui.md's "Extending the canvas": the map is a React
component (``canvas/MapPanel.tsx``) registered into jutul-agent's own webapp,
not a separate page in an iframe — so there is exactly one process, one
server, one Julia kernel per chat session, and no dedicated standalone kernel
to keep warm (compare this file's size to its predecessor,
``examples/geothermal-viz-app/serve.py``).

Everything the agent needs is read straight off disk in the same process (see
capability.py's ``_load_well_features``); the only thing that has to happen
separately, beforehand, is the one-time data-processing step
(``scripts/process_data.jl``) that produced ``data/all_boreholes.geojson`` in
the first place.

This example runs on jutul-agent's built-in ``fimbul`` simulator and its
already-declared Julia environment — no extra Julia setup of its own. Run it
with ``python examples/geothermal-map/serve.py``.
