"""The geothermal map capability: tools that let the agent drive the native map
panel (see ``canvas/MapPanel.tsx`` in jutul-agent's webapp) by well name or
location.

Each tool below emits a `ui` trace event targeted at the map's own canvas view
(``target="slot:geothermal-map"``), which ``MapPanel.tsx`` picks up via its
``useUiActions`` hook — the same agent-to-UI pattern Phase 0's throwaway demo
proved (``fly_test_map``), just for a real well lookup instead of bare
coordinates. There is no dedicated Julia kernel and no second server here: the
map panel lives in the same process and the same session as the chat, ported
from geothermal-viz's ``web/js/app.js`` (rendering) and
``examples/geothermal-viz-app/capability.py`` (this file's predecessor).

This module is the skeleton for growing the agent's reach into the map: adding
a new ability means adding one ``_make_..._tool`` factory below, wiring it into
``geothermal_map_capability``'s ``tools`` tuple, and adding the matching case to
``MapPanel.tsx``'s `ui` action dispatch. Nothing else needs to change to pick
it up — serve.py passes whatever this returns straight into the session.

A tool that *asks* the map to do something (like ``set_map_view``) can return
right away — there's nothing to get wrong. But ``go_to_well``/``go_to_well_park``
resolve the well themselves, against the same GeoJSON file the map renders
from (read directly off disk here — no HTTP self-call, since the tool and the
data live in the same process now), so the agent can give an honest answer
immediately instead of waiting for the browser to report back on the *next*
message (see docs/server-interface.md's ui_event queueing).

The simulation tools (``run_simulation``, ``view_simulation_result``) reuse
geothermal-viz's own ``julia/simulation.jl`` verbatim — ``include()``d once into
the session's own kernel — rather than porting its Fimbul/parameter-mapping
logic into Python. ``make_run_simulation_action``/``make_setup_simulation_action``
are the map's two direct, non-LLM entry points (the sidebar's "Setup
Simulation"/"Run" buttons): for when the front end already has exact,
structured inputs and there is nothing for the model to decide — see
docs/server-interface.md and jutul_agent.interfaces.server.app.ActionHandler.
