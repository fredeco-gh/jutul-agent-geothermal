"""Fold a review's findings into the curated issue store.

An agent decides whether each new finding is the *same* underlying issue as one
already tracked (merge) or a new one (create) — matching on root cause, not
wording. The store bookkeeping (counts, sessions, severity, examples) is then
applied deterministically in :mod:`jutul_agent.review.issues`. This is the
"intelligently update the log" step: many raw findings collapse into a few
high-signal, growing issues.
