"""Findings a session review produces, and the developer-only log they append to.

A :class:`ReviewReport` is one critic pass over one session: a short summary plus
a list of :class:`Finding`. Reports are appended as JSON lines to a single log
under the state home so the developer can browse what the agent (or its in-Julia
validation) missed across many runs — this is a developer tool, never shown to the
end user.
