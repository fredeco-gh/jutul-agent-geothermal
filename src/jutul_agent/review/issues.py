"""The curated issue store: recurring findings merged into distinct issues.

The findings log (``findings.jsonl``) is the raw, append-only record — one entry
per review, duplicates and all. This store sits on top of it: an evolving set of
*distinct* issues, each accumulating how often it has been seen, in which sessions,
and a few representative examples. New findings are folded in by
:mod:`jutul_agent.review.curate` (an agent decides what is the same issue); the
bookkeeping here — counts, severity, examples — is deterministic.

It is the developer's high-signal view: "this unit-conversion gap has shown up 7
times across 5 sessions" instead of 7 separate log lines.
