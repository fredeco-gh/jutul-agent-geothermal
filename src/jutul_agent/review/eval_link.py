"""Link an eval run's scores back onto the sessions it produced.

An eval session already carries the expected answer (recorded by the solver); the
pass/fail verdict, though, is computed by the scorers afterwards and lives in the
inspect log, not the session. This closes that gap: after an eval run, write each
sample's verdict onto its session trace as an ``eval_result`` event, so a later
review can say "the agent's answer looked fine but the run scored FAIL" and the
dashboard can badge it.
