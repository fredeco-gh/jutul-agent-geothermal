# Ensemble helpers for jutul-agent: warm Distributed workers + pmap, for the
# parallel runs an uncertainty quantification or parameter sweep needs. Loaded into
# the session on demand (like julia_plot.jl), so it adds no environment dependency.
#
# Design: the agent's eval runs in the *master* process, so `addprocs` + `pmap`
# here are the standard Julia pattern — the master has every package loaded, so the
# "packages must be on the master" class of failure (the old worker-based backend's
# pain) cannot occur. Workers inherit the master's project and system image, so they
# boot warm.

Run `f(case)` for each `case` in `cases` in parallel across warm workers and return
the results in order. Spawns workers as needed (up to `nworkers`, capped at the
number of cases), optionally evaluates `setup` (an expression, e.g.
`:(using JutulDarcy)`) on every worker first, `pmap`s the work, then removes the
workers it spawned unless `keep_workers`.

`f` runs on the workers, so anything it needs must be available there: load packages
via `setup`, and prefer a named top-level function over a closure capturing local
state.

"""
    _pmap_with_progress(f, cases) -> Vector

`pmap` with a live `ProgressMeter` bar driven from the master. A worker's stdout
reaches the master only interleaved and prefixed (`From worker N:`), and a solve
under `info_level = -1` is silent, so a plain parallel run gives no clean progress
signal, looks hung, and may be cancelled while fine. A single ordered bar fixes that.

`ProgressMeter.progress_pmap` won't do: it serialises a `ProgressMeter` closure to
the workers, which our fresh warm workers don't have loaded. Instead the bar lives
on the master and each case is dispatched with `remotecall_fetch(f, pool, case)`, so
only `f` and the case cross to a worker (exactly `pmap`'s serialisation, no
worker-side dependency) while `next!` ticks here as each returns. `asyncmap` keeps
one in-flight call per worker and preserves input order, like `pmap`.
