"""Set up and reconcile a workspace's Julia environment.

Each simulator ships a template env at ``simulators/<name>/julia_env/``
(already declaring the simulator's package dependencies). Bootstrap = copy
the template into the workspace, optionally ``Pkg.develop`` a user-provided
source path, optionally ``Pkg.instantiate`` to precompile.
:func:`prepare_workspace_env` is the launch-time entry point that makes a
missing or drifted env ready, best-effort, before the kernel starts.

A workspace that already has its own root ``Project.toml`` is left alone:
the user owns that env, and we only run dev and instantiate on request.
