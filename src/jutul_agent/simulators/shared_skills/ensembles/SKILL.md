# Ensembles and parameter sweeps

## When to use

Use this when a task runs the **same simulation many times** with different inputs —
uncertainty quantification, parameter sweeps, sensitivity studies — and the runs are
independent. For a single run, just use `julia_eval`.

When the task asks for a parallel ensemble, run it in parallel — don't quietly
fall back to a serial loop. If the parallel path fails, fix it or say so.

## How

The session loads the `JutulAgent` package, which exports `run_ensemble` (if it's
not yet defined, run `using JutulAgent` first). Call it from `julia_eval`
(`MySim` below stands for whatever packages the case function needs):

```julia
run_ensemble(run_case, cases; nworkers=4, setup=:(using MySim))
```

- `run_case` — a function applied to each case; it runs **on a worker process**.
- `cases` — the inputs to sweep (a vector). Results come back in this order.
- `nworkers` — how many worker processes to spawn (capped at `length(cases)`).
- `setup` — an expression run on every worker first, to load whatever `run_case`
  needs. Required whenever `run_case` uses a package.

It spawns **warm** workers (they inherit this session's project and system image, so
no second precompile), runs the cases in parallel, returns the results in order, and
removes the workers it spawned afterwards.

## Rules (Distributed gotchas)

- **Anything defined only in this session does not exist on the workers.** Workers
  are spawned fresh inside `run_ensemble`; a *named* function from this session is
  serialised by name only, so the run fails with `UndefVarError(#run_case)`. The
  same applies to session globals (`GRID`, `SYS`, ...) referenced inside the case
  function — and to a `do` block that merely *wraps* a session-defined function:
  the wrapper serialises, the call inside it still fails.
- Two patterns that work (pick by size):
  1. **Inline `do` block, fully self-contained**: every binding it uses is either
     built inside it, passed through `cases`, or comes from a package loaded via
     `setup`.
  2. **Define the case function in a workspace file and `include` it via `setup`**,
     so every worker has the definition; then the named function can be passed
     directly.
- `setup` must be a quoted expression like `:(using MySim)` (`nothing`,
  not `:(nothing)`, to skip it).
- Keep what each case returns small (a scalar, a NamedTuple of metrics) — large return
  objects are serialised back to this process.

## Example (inline do-block)

```julia
# Sweep a parameter; each worker builds its own case and returns a scalar metric.
results = run_ensemble(
    [0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25];
    nworkers = 4, setup = :(using MySim),
) do p
    # build the case from `p`, run it, extract the metric — everything in here
    return metric   # small return value
end
```

## Example (case function in a file)

```julia
# sweep_case.jl in the workspace defines `run_case(case)` at top level.
results = run_ensemble(
    run_case, cases;
    nworkers = 4,
    setup = :(begin using MySim; include("sweep_case.jl") end),
)
```

The `include` runs on every worker (their working directory is the workspace), so
`run_case` resolves there. This is the better pattern once the case function is
more than a few lines: it stays editable as a file and runs serially too
(`map(run_case, cases)`) for debugging one case first.

For very heavy sweeps, set `nworkers` to the cores you want to use; for a one-off
parallel block you can also drop to plain `Distributed` (`addprocs`, `@everywhere`,
`pmap`) inside `julia_eval` — `run_ensemble` is just the ergonomic path.
