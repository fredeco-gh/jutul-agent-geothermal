"""Simulator registry: discovers adapters from packages, in-tree and installed.

A simulator's adapter is found two ways, so neither this file nor any other core
file needs editing to add one:

- **Bundled**: each subpackage under ``jutul_agent.simulators`` with an
  ``adapter.py`` defining a module-level :class:`SimulatorAdapter`. Adding a
  bundled simulator is just adding its folder.
- **Installed**: any installed package that publishes a ``SimulatorAdapter``
  under the ``jutul_agent.simulators`` entry-point group. This is how a separate
  project adds its own simulator without forking jutul-agent (see
  docs/extending-for-your-application.md). An installed adapter overrides a
  bundled one of the same name.
