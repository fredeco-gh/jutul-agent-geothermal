"""Construct the Deep Agents runtime for a Session.

This module wires everything ``create_deep_agent`` needs in one place:

- ``build_backend``: the real-path CompositeBackend over the workspace
  (skills, memory, package source, and added folders all at their real paths).
- ``register_provider_profiles``: ``HarnessProfile`` registration per
  provider (disables the default general-purpose subagent; all prompt text
  lives in ``agent.prompts``).
- ``build_agent``: the entry point used by the CLI/TUI. Returns the agent
  together with its live backend, so callers can add extra folders
  mid-session (``/add-dir``).
