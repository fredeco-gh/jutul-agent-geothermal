"""Julia source the plotting tools send to the REPL.

These are pure string builders: given Python values (paths, sizes, the user's
code) they return the Julia snippet ``plot_julia.py`` evaluates. Keeping the
code generation here, apart from the tool orchestration (tracing, the artifact
record, the model-facing reply), means every piece of Julia the plotting tools
run lives in one place and the Python side reads as plain control flow.

Two render paths share one figure-resolution preamble:

- the native **GLMakie** path (``render_call``) used by the terminal, which
  captures the figure to a PNG and optionally opens a live window, and
- the **web** path (``web_render_call`` / ``web_live_call``) used by the browser
  UI, which renders with WGLMakie and either exports self-contained HTML or
  routes the live figure on the session's Bonito server.
