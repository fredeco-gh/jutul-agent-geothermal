"""Tool-result clearing to bound context growth between compactions.

Long sessions accumulate many medium-sized tool results — source reads, REPL
output — that no single eviction is large enough to catch and that summarization
only sweeps up once the window is nearly full. langchain's
``ContextEditingMiddleware`` clears the *older* tool results to a placeholder
once the context crosses a threshold, keeping the most recent ones verbatim. It
is non-mutating (it edits a copy of the request, leaving ``state["messages"]``
intact) and is wired to run ahead of
summarization, so most growth is handled by this cheap pass and the LLM summary
call is reserved for when clearing is not enough. Cleared results stay
re-derivable: the underlying files are still on disk and REPL commands can be
re-run.
