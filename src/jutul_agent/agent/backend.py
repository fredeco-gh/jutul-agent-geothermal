    """Workspace default backend: real paths, with a guard against shell ``julia``.

    Constructed with ``virtual_mode=False`` so the file tools speak the real
    filesystem: a relative path resolves against the workspace (the backend's
    ``cwd``) and an absolute path as itself, the same way ``julia_eval`` and
    ``execute`` resolve paths from that working directory. One path string
    therefore names one file in the file tools, the shell, and the REPL. Package
    source, skills, memory, and added folders are all read and written at their
    real paths through this one backend.

    ``readonly_roots`` are real directories writes are refused under: the
    shared Julia depot's installed package source. Reads and greps there are
    fine (that's how the agent studies a package); only ``write``/``edit`` are
    blocked, so the agent can't corrupt the depot for other projects. A
    ``Pkg.develop`` checkout lives outside the depot and stays writable, so the
    registry-vs-dev distinction falls out of the path, with no special-casing.

    ``execute`` refuses to launch ``julia``: Julia belongs in the session
    kernel, where state persists and output streams; a shell julia is a cold
    process that shares nothing with the session. A prompt rule alone does not
    reliably stop models from shelling out; the tool guaranteeing it does.
    Other interpreters are deliberately not blocked: shell python and friends
    are part of general competence, and scientific results are kept honest by
    the bench's trace checks, not by a blanket ban.
