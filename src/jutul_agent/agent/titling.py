"""Best-effort, content-aware session titles.

A session is named from its first prompt immediately (``derive_session_title``)
so it is never nameless in a history list. After the first turn this asks the
model for a short title that reflects what the exchange was actually about and
replaces the first-prompt one. It is strictly best-effort: no API key, an
offline model, or a slow/empty reply just keeps the first-prompt title, so the
feature can never make naming worse.
