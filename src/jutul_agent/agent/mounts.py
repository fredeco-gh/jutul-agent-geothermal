"""Track additional working directories the user adds to the session.

The agent's filesystem uses real paths (see ``agent.builder.build_backend``), so
an added folder is already reachable at its absolute path by every tool:
``read_file``, ``grep``, ``write_file``, ``execute``, and ``julia_eval`` alike.
Adding a folder just validates the path and records it on the live backend so
the session can list what was added (via the ``--add-dir`` flag at launch or the
TUI ``/add-dir`` command). Records are session-scoped: they live until the
process exits and are not persisted.
