"""Let the deepagents filesystem tools accept real Windows absolute paths.

The agent runs its filesystem backend in real-path mode (``virtual_mode=False``;
see :mod:`jutul_agent.agent.backend`), so every path a tool receives is a real OS
path — the same string the shell and the Julia REPL use. But deepagents'
``FilesystemMiddleware`` routes each path through ``validate_path`` *before* the
backend sees it, and that helper is written for *virtual* paths: it rejects
anything matching a Windows drive letter (``C:\\...``) outright.

On POSIX this is invisible — a real absolute path starts with ``/``, which
``validate_path`` accepts — so the mismatch only bites on Windows, where real
paths start with ``C:\\``. There it breaks the workflow the agent depends on:
``pkgdir(JutulDarcy)`` returns ``C:\\Users\\...\\.julia\\packages\\...``, and every
``read_file``/``grep``/``ls`` of installed package source is rejected, forcing the
model to shell out to PowerShell ``Get-Content`` for everything.

The fix wraps ``validate_path`` so a Windows drive-absolute path passes through
unchanged (the real-path backend resolves it directly, exactly as it already does
for the shell and REPL), while every other path keeps the original virtual-path
validation — traversal guards and POSIX normalization included. The middleware
looks ``validate_path`` up as a module global at call time, so replacing the name
on the middleware module reaches every file tool it builds.

This is a targeted shim over a deepagents internal; it can be dropped once
deepagents stops rejecting real Windows paths in real-path mode (e.g. gating
``validate_path`` on ``virtual_mode``).
