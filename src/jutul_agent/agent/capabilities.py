"""Capabilities: the layers an agent is composed from.

The agent for a session is built from layers: the base tools and skills, the
active simulator, the front end (surface), and whatever a host application adds.
Each layer is a ``Capability`` that can contribute tools, skills, subagents, and
a fragment of the system prompt. ``build_agent`` collects the contributions of
every capability that applies to the current surface.

A capability reaches the agent three ways: passed in directly, discovered from
an installed package's entry points (``discover_extensions``), or built from a
host application's declarative tool specs (``http_tool_capability``). The first
two carry in-process Python tools; the third lets an application in any language
expose its own routines over HTTP.
