"""Manual /compact, plus the auto-compaction trigger figure for /context.

Auto-compaction is deepagents' stock ``SummarizationMiddleware`` — installed by
``create_deep_agent`` and sized from the model profile, which
``builder._set_profile_window`` points at the real loaded window;
``TraceRecorder`` surfaces each compaction as a ``context_compaction`` trace
event. This module keeps two small things on top of it: the trigger figure
``/context`` displays, and ``compact_thread`` — the manual ``/compact`` command,
which drives the same deepagents engine on demand against the checkpointed
thread (the deepagents-cli ``/offload`` pattern), non-mutating and recoverable.
