"""Julia plotting tools: capture Makie figures as session artifacts.

Plotting always runs on GLMakie. The tool opens a live window for the user only
when the session can show one (an interactive run with a display); otherwise it
renders offscreen to a PNG. Headless Linux still renders, via the xvfb-wrapped
Julia process (see the kernel). If GLMakie cannot load at all, the tool
returns a clear error rather than degrading to a backend where the native
plotters do not work.

When ``view=True`` the saved PNG is downscaled and returned to the model as a
multimodal image block, so the agent can see the plot it just made.

On the web surface, figures render in the browser with WGLMakie. They are served
live from a per-session Bonito server when it can start, so a figure's in-figure
widgets (a timestep slider, a field selector) run their Julia callbacks and update
the view; if the server can't start, a self-contained static HTML export is
embedded instead (camera control still works, the widgets do not).

This module is the orchestration: it loads the backend, runs the generated Julia
(see ``plot_julia_src``), records the artifact, and builds the model-facing reply.
