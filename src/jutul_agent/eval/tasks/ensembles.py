"""Ensemble suite: the parallel-sweep workflow through ``run_ensemble``.

One task per simulator, each sweeping a real case the simulator ships or the
workspace provides: a waterflood, a battery discharge, a geothermal doublet, a
CO2-capture cycle. Each runs inside its simulator's workspace env, because
``run_ensemble`` ships in the JutulAgent runtime package that only exists there,
and worker processes inherit that env. The real check is the trace:
``run_ensemble`` (or plain ``pmap``) must appear in code the agent actually
executed, so a serial fallback or a textual claim cannot pass. A real
simulation cannot be shortcut by recalling a value or reimplementing it in
another language, which is what makes these robust mechanism checks (a cheap
arithmetic sweep, by contrast, the model could just compute directly).
