"""API-discovery suite: how efficiently does the agent learn an unfamiliar API?

Models often spend many turns probing how to call functions (`@doc`,
`methods`, trial-and-error in `julia_eval`) before doing the work. That
exploration is not wrong (reading the real API beats guessing), but a good
harness makes it cheap. This suite measures the cost on a controlled API: the
synthetic ``MiniRes`` package (see ``_corpus``) ships in the workspace but is
not installed and is absent from any training data, so the agent must learn its
signatures from the source it can read, then call them correctly.

Hermetic and environment-free, so it is fast and reproducible::

    uv run jutul-agent eval api_discovery

Each task pairs a correctness check (a value only a correct call produces) with
the efficiency counters (:func:`tool_call_count`, :func:`file_op_count`,
:func:`julia_probe_count`). The discriminating signal is not whether the model
gets the answer (capable models do) but how many probes and reads it took to
get there, which is what a skill, prompt, or mount change aimed at faster API
discovery should move.
