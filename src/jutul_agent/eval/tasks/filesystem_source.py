"""Per-simulator filesystem round-trip against the real installed env.

The :mod:`~jutul_agent.eval.tasks.filesystem` suite is hermetic (no simulator
environment); this is its realism counterpart, the way
:mod:`~jutul_agent.eval.tasks.search_source` is to
:mod:`~jutul_agent.eval.tasks.search`. Each sample instantiates the simulator's
Julia environment (``needs_env``), so the file tools, the read-only depot
guard, and the loaded simulator stack are all present, and checks that the path
model still holds with them in play: locate the installed package source at its
real ``pkgdir`` path, then write a workspace file by a relative path. The first
run on a cold depot is slow, so this is the opt-in realism layer rather than
part of the fast default::

    uv run jutul-agent eval filesystem_source

Grading is structural and robust to upstream churn: the workspace output file
must exist and the answer must name the package whose source path was found
(``pkgdir`` reports it for whatever version is installed). Exact paths and
filenames inside the depot are deliberately not pinned, since they move with
each release and the Julia depot hashes them.
