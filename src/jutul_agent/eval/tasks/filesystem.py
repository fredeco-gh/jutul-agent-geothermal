"""Filesystem suite: resolving workspace paths the agent keeps tripping on.

The file tools (`read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `glob`, `ls`),
`run_julia`, `plot_julia`, and `execute` all share the workspace as their
working directory and resolve the same real paths: a workspace file is a
relative path (``model.jl``) or its absolute path, and a bare leading slash
(``/model.jl``) is the machine root, not the workspace. Writing a workspace
file with a leading slash, saving outside the workspace, or losing track of
where a file went is the recurring failure this suite measures.

Every sample is fixture-driven and needs no simulator environment, so the
suite is fast, hermetic, and does not chase upstream package changes. It runs
on any model, like the canary::

    uv run jutul-agent eval filesystem

Most capable models *can* do these. The point is doing them cleanly, in few
steps. Alongside the correctness checks, every task carries efficiency counters
(:func:`tool_call_count`, :func:`file_op_count`, :func:`julia_probe_count`):
re-reading, re-listing, and retrying writes is the visible cost of path
confusion, so a harness change that keeps the suite green while lowering the
file-op count is what "less confusing paths" looks like in numbers.
