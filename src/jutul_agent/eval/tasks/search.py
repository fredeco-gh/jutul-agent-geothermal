"""Search suite: can the agent find things with the file-search tools?

Each sample drops a small, fixed Julia package (``pkg/MiniRes``, see
``_corpus``) into the workspace and asks a retrieval question: where is a
function defined, which example uses it, which files call it, how many files of
a kind exist, what value a constant takes, and a multi-hop chase across files.
The corpus is synthetic and hermetic, so the suite is fast, runs on any model
with no simulator environment, and gives the same answers on every machine::

    uv run jutul-agent eval search

Because the corpus and its ground truth are fixed, this suite is also the
instrument for the open question of whether plain ``grep``/``glob`` retrieval
is enough or whether something heavier (BM25, embeddings) is worth adding:
swap the retrieval mechanism, rerun, compare. Each task pairs an answer check
(did it find the right thing) with efficiency counters (:func:`tool_call_count`,
:func:`file_op_count`): a model that answers by reading every file is
distinguishable from one that searched, and a retrieval change that keeps the
answers right while lowering the file-op count is a measurable win.
