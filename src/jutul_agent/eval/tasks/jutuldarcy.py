"""JutulDarcy suite: seed tasks for the reservoir-simulation workflows.

These instantiate the JutulDarcy workspace environment (``needs_env``), so
the first run on a cold depot takes minutes. Checks are structural
properties that must hold for any correct run; until golden references
captured from trusted baseline runs are added alongside.
