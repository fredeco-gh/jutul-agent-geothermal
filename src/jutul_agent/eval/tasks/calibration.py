"""Calibration suite: an iterative investigation, graded on the recorded process.

No simulator environment is needed: the agent fits a two-parameter model
to workspace data through the Julia session. The scorers read the
``attempt`` events in the trace, so a correct answer with an unrecorded
process still fails.
