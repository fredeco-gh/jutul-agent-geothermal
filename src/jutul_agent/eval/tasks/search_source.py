"""Per-simulator search against real installed source on disk.

The :mod:`~jutul_agent.eval.tasks.search` suite measures retrieval on a fixed
synthetic corpus; this one measures it on the genuine article: each
simulator's installed package source, found at its real path (``pkgdir`` in the
REPL) and read with the file tools. It instantiates the simulator's Julia
environment (``needs_env``), so the first run on a cold depot is slow and this
suite is the opt-in realism layer rather than part of the fast default::

    uv run jutul-agent eval search_source

To stay robust against upstream churn, grading is structural and pinned to the
one fact that holds for every Julia package across every release: its source
tree contains a main module file ``src/<Package>.jl``. The agent must locate the
source (via ``pkgdir``) and report that path. Exact line numbers, example
filenames, and symbol locations are deliberately not graded; those move with
each release, and chasing them would make the suite flaky.
