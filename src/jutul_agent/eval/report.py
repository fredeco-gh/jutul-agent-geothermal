"""Render benchmark results from eval logs into a markdown page.

The published artifact is a *snapshot*: each model runs the suite a few times
and the cells aggregate those runs (a 2/3 fraction is two passes of three
runs). Cross-run history beyond the snapshot is deliberately not shown —
skills, tasks, and the harness all move between snapshots, so older rows
rarely measure the same problem. The raw ``.eval`` logs stay local; the
rendered page and its JSON source are committed.

The committed ``docs/benchmark-records.jsonl`` is the snapshot's source data,
so the page can be regenerated, and extended with a new model, without the
original ``.eval`` logs: ``--records`` merges that file with fresh logs, with
runs accumulating (one record per sample-run, deduped on run and epoch).

Usage::

    uv run python -m jutul_agent.eval.report 2026-06-12T18 -o docs/benchmark.md
    uv run python -m jutul_agent.eval.report 2026-06-12T18 --json records.jsonl
    # add a model's fresh run to the published snapshot:
    uv run python -m jutul_agent.eval.report <new-prefix> \
        --records docs/benchmark-records.jsonl \
        --json docs/benchmark-records.jsonl -o docs/benchmark.md
