# Julia kernel server (standard library only). Shipped as a resource and run as
#   julia [flags] server.jl <control_port>      with env JK_TOKEN set
#
# One loopback TCP connection carries the whole protocol as length-prefixed
# frames: an ASCII header line "TYPE [args...] NBYTES\n" followed by exactly
# NBYTES raw payload bytes. No payload ever travels as a bare line, so frame
# size is unbounded and binary-safe in both directions.
#
#   Julia -> parent:  RDY <token> 0              handshake
#                     OUT <stdout|stderr> <n>    live output bytes
#                     RES <id> <ok|err|int> <n>  one result per eval
#   parent -> Julia:  EXE <id> <n>               code to evaluate
#
# stdout/stderr are captured *in this process*: the fds are redirected to pipes
# (fd-level via dup2, so output written by C libraries is included) and pump
# tasks forward the bytes as OUT frames. After each eval the server writes a
# MARKER to both streams and sends RES only once the pumps have forwarded
# everything before it, so a result frame is always preceded by all the output
# its eval produced — ordering comes from TCP itself and the parent never has
# to stitch separate streams back together. The process's real stdout/stderr
# (the pipes the parent owns) carry only pre-handshake boot noise.
#
# Threading: the parent launches Julia with an interactive thread (`-t N,1`),
# which pins the root task — this eval loop — to the interactive thread, while
# the pumps run on the default pool. SIGINT -> InterruptException is delivered
# on the root task's thread, so a pump can never swallow an interrupt meant for
# the eval (its own sigatomic windows would otherwise eat it).
