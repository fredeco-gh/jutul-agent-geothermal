"""Compute-thread policy for the Julia kernel.

One place that decides how many compute threads the kernel's Julia process gets,
and the BLAS coordination that keeps that from oversubscribing the machine. The
launch path (``run.py``) uses :func:`resolve_compute_threads` for the kernel's
``--threads`` and :func:`blas_thread_env` for the environment.

Julia's compute-thread count is fixed at process launch, so the knob is the
``--threads`` flag / environment variable read here, not something the session can
change at runtime.
