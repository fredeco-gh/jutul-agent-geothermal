"""The FastAPI application: REST lifecycle plus the per-session turn WebSocket.

REST creates, lists, resumes, and closes sessions, and serves the files a
session produces. The WebSocket at ``/sessions/{id}/stream`` carries one turn at
a time: the client sends a prompt (or an approval decision, or a cancel), and
the server streams the agent's events back, serialized by ``protocol``.

``create_app`` takes a ``SessionManager`` so tests can inject one whose sessions
wrap fakes; the default manager stands up real sessions.
