A scientific AI agent for differentiable simulators built on the
[Jutul](https://github.com/sintefmath/Jutul.jl) framework. Ask for a
simulation in plain language. The agent sets it up, runs it, analyses and
plots the results, and iterates: fixing mistakes and refining the next run.

What makes it work for scientific computing:

- A persistent Julia REPL per session. State, loaded packages, and compiled
  methods carry across turns, and a first solve is fast because each
  simulator ships a precompiled warm package.
- The agent reads real source. Every package in the environment is on disk at
  its real `pkgdir` path (read-only in the shared depot), so answers come from
  the installed version, not from memory.
- Everything is recorded. Each session writes a trace of every message, tool
  call, and artifact. Transcripts and the benchmark grade against it.
- Models are interchangeable: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, or local models via
  Ollama, switchable mid-session.

## Supported simulators

| `--sim` | Package | Domain |
|---|---|---|
| `jutuldarcy` | [JutulDarcy.jl](https://github.com/sintefmath/JutulDarcy.jl) | Reservoir / multi-phase flow |
| `battmo` | [BattMo.jl](https://github.com/BattMoTeam/BattMo.jl) | Lithium-ion (and other) battery cells |
| `fimbul` | [Fimbul.jl](https://github.com/sintefmath/Fimbul.jl) | Geothermal (ATES, BTES, doublet, EGS) |
| `mocca` | [Mocca.jl](https://github.com/sintefmath/Mocca.jl) | Adsorption-based CO₂ capture (PSA / VSA / TSA) |

## Install

You need two tools on PATH:

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), which
  installs Python and manages the tool
- Julia 1.10 or newer, via [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup)

On headless Linux, plotting also needs `xvfb`.

Install jutul-agent as a uv tool. This puts a `jutul-agent` command on your
PATH that works from any folder:

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/SINTEF-agentlab/jutul-agent
```

Upgrade any time with `jutul-agent upgrade`.

API keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) can go in
your environment or a `.env`. jutul-agent also prompts for a missing key and
saves it. Local models through [Ollama](https://ollama.com) need no key.
Details in the
[installation and usage guide](https://sintef-agentlab.github.io/jutul-agent/usage/).

## First run

jutul-agent works in the directory you launch it from: that folder becomes the
workspace where it reads and writes files, bound to one simulator. Set up a fresh
folder, then pick an interface.

```sh
mkdir my-battery-run && cd my-battery-run
jutul-agent init --sim battmo --precompile
```

`jutul-agent` has three interfaces — choose one explicitly (bare `jutul-agent`
just lists them):

```sh
jutul-agent web      # browser UI: chat with interactive plots and reports (the usual way)
jutul-agent tui      # terminal UI
jutul-agent run "Plot a constant-current discharge of the chen_2020 cell"   # one headless turn
```

`jutul-agent web` opens at <http://127.0.0.1:8742>; the agent runs the simulator,
writes and runs Julia, and pins interactive plots and reports in a panel beside
the chat. It is the same agent and session core as the terminal, so anything in
one works in the other.

`--sim` takes any simulator from the table above, and the workflow is the same
for all of them. The first `--precompile` takes a while (Julia compiles the
simulator and the plotting stack), after which sessions start in seconds. If
anything fails, `jutul-agent doctor` diagnoses the setup and prints a fix per
finding.

One folder is bound to one simulator and its Julia environment; use another
simulator from another folder. The web interface runs locally for a single
trusted user — the [server interface guide](docs/server-interface.md) covers the
HTTP/WebSocket protocol and embedding the agent in your own application.

## Documentation

The full documentation lives at
[sintef-agentlab.github.io/jutul-agent](https://sintef-agentlab.github.io/jutul-agent/)
(source in [docs/](docs/)): using the agent, how it works (architecture,
the Julia kernel, the trace), and extending it (adding a simulator,
improving the agent, evaluation).

## Development

Work from a clone instead of a tool install. `uv run` resolves the
`jutul-agent` command from the checkout, so run every command through it
(`uv run jutul-agent ...`); upgrade with `git pull && uv sync`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/SINTEF-agentlab/jutul-agent
cd jutul-agent
uv sync --extra eval
uv run pre-commit install

uv run ruff check .              # lint
uv run pytest                    # unit tests (integration and live skipped)
uv run pytest -m integration     # adds the Julia-requiring tests
uv run jutul-agent eval canary   # bench canary
```
