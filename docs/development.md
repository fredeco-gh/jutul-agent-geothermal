# Development

This page is the practical reference: setup, layout, tests, CI, policies.
The reasoning behind much of it, a codebase built with coding agents from
the start, is its own page: [agent-first development](agent-first.md).

## Setup

```sh
git clone <this-repo> && cd jutul-agent
uv sync --extra eval
uv run pre-commit install
```

`uv sync` creates `.venv/` from `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`. Re-run it
when those change. The `eval` extra adds Inspect AI for the bench.

## Repository layout

```
src/jutul_agent/
  paths.py         install / workspace / state-home anchors, path-resolution policy
  workspace.py     config loader, simulator auto-detect, env bootstrap helpers
  session.py       Session: the unit of one invocation
  models.py        provider metadata, model catalog
  credentials.py   user-global API-key storage
  display.py       display detection, managed Xvfb for headless plotting
  agent/           deepagents wiring: builder, prompts, tools, turns, memory
  simulators/      adapter base + registry, one data folder per simulator
  julia/           JuliaSession protocol, Julia toolchain checks
  juliakernel/     the supervised Julia runtime (kernel.py + server.jl)
  julia_runtime/   the shared JutulAgent Julia package, synced into envs
  trace/           append-only SQLite event log + recorder middleware
  transcript/      HTML / markdown / report renderers
  eval/            jutul-bench: solver, scorers, runconfig, task suites
  interfaces/      cli/ and tui/
tests/             unit suite (integration/ and live/ are opt-in)
docs/              this documentation
```

## Tests

```sh
uv run pytest                    # unit tests (integration and live deselected)
uv run pytest -m integration     # adds Julia-requiring tests
uv run pytest tests/live/        # one real-LLM smoke (needs a provider key)
uv run pytest --snapshot-update  # accept changed syrupy snapshots, deliberately
```

How the tiers, gating, fakes, snapshots, and TUI pilot tests fit together
is its own page: [testing](testing.md).

## CI

Two workflows:

- `ci.yml`, on every PR: lint (ruff check + format), the unit suite on
  Linux/macOS/Windows, a Julia kernel integration job, and a plot
  integration job that instantiates the JutulDarcy env under xvfb and
  renders a real GLMakie figure.
- `simulators.yml`, on PRs and weekly: one job per simulator that
  instantiates its env template against the latest compatible upstream
  releases and smoke-tests that the package and the warm package load. The
  weekly run is the canary for upstream breakage, since envs ship no
  version pins.

Both instantiate steps run an explicit `Pkg.precompile()`, which throws if
a direct dependency fails to precompile. A bare `Pkg.instantiate()` only
auto-precompiles best-effort and exits 0, which can leave a lane green
while every env on the runner is broken.

## The bench in the dev loop

Before and after a change to the prompt, a skill, or a tool, run the cheap
suites on the default model:

```sh
uv run jutul-agent eval canary guardrails
```

See [evaluation](evaluation.md) for scorers, RunConfig attribution, and
adding tasks.

## Dependency policy

Dependencies are locked (`uv.lock`). Upgrade deliberately with
`uv lock --upgrade-package <name>` and run the suite. deepagents in
particular is pinned to a known-good version: it moves fast, and its
middleware/streaming internals have broken us before. Treat any deepagents
bump as a change that needs the live smoke and a TUI pilot pass.

## Releasing

The package version is derived from git tags by hatch-vcs, so a release is a
tag rather than a manual version bump. A tag `vX.Y.Z` builds as version
`X.Y.Z`; commits past the latest tag build as a `.devN` pre-release. The
runtime reads the version back through `importlib.metadata`
(`jutul_agent.__version__`), and the update checker compares it against the
latest release published on PyPI.

Publishing is automated by `.github/workflows/release.yml`, which runs when a
GitHub Release is published: it builds the sdist and wheel, verifies the built
version equals the release tag, and uploads to PyPI with trusted publishing
(OIDC), so no API token is stored in the repository. Trusted publishing is
configured once on PyPI (a publisher for owner `SINTEF-agentlab`, repository
`jutul-agent`, workflow `release.yml`, environment `pypi`) against a GitHub
Environment of the same name.

Cutting a release:

1. Make sure `main` is at the commit to ship and CI is green.
2. Create a GitHub Release with the tag `vX.Y.Z` targeting `main` (the UI
   creates the tag), and write the release notes.
3. Publishing the release triggers the workflow, which builds and uploads to
   PyPI.
4. Verify with `uv tool install --reinstall jutul-agent`, then check that
   `jutul-agent --version` reports `X.Y.Z` and the new release shows on the
   PyPI project page.

## The docs site

The documentation in `docs/` doubles as an MkDocs Material site
(`mkdocs.yml` at the repo root):

```sh
uv sync --group docs
uv run mkdocs serve     # live-preview at http://127.0.0.1:8000
uv run mkdocs build --strict
```

Install the `docs` group (it pulls in `mkdocs-material`), not bare `mkdocs`:
a plain `uv pip install mkdocs` lacks the Material theme and fails with
`cannot find module 'material.extensions.emoji'`. `uv run --group docs
mkdocs serve` also works without a prior `uv sync` if you prefer.

The `Docs` workflow checks the strict build on docs-touching pull requests
and deploys the site to GitHub Pages when docs change on main.

The architecture diagram is TikZ source (`docs/assets/architecture.tex`)
compiled offline to `architecture-light.svg` and `architecture-dark.svg`.
To change it, edit the `.tex`, regenerate, preview on the built site in
both palettes (`uv run mkdocs serve`), then commit the `.tex` and both SVGs.
Requires `latex` and `dvisvgm` (Debian: `texlive-latex-base`, `dvisvgm`):

```sh
docs/assets/render-architecture.sh
```
