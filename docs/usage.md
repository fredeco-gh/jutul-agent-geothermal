# Installation and usage

## Installation

You need two tools on PATH:

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), which
  installs Python and manages the tool
- Julia 1.10 or newer, via [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup)

On headless Linux, plotting also needs `xvfb`.

Install jutul-agent as a uv tool. This puts a `jutul-agent` command on your
PATH that runs from any folder:

```sh
uv tool install git+https://github.com/SINTEF-agentlab/jutul-agent
```

Once the package is on PyPI this shortens to `uv tool install jutul-agent`.
Either way, `jutul-agent upgrade` keeps it current (see
[Upgrading](#upgrading)).

API keys (`OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`) can go in
your environment or a `.env`. jutul-agent also prompts for a missing key and
saves it to the user-global `.env`. Local models through
[Ollama](https://ollama.com) need no key. `jutul-agent doctor`
verifies the whole setup and prints a fix per finding.

Prefer a clone for hacking on jutul-agent itself? See
[development](development.md), where you run commands as `uv run jutul-agent`.

## Workspaces

`jutul-agent` runs in the directory you invoke it from. That directory is the
workspace: the agent reads and writes files there, and the Julia environment
lives in `.jutul-agent/julia-env/` inside it. Start it from a project folder.
Initialise once per folder:

```sh
mkdir my-reservoir-study && cd my-reservoir-study
jutul-agent init --sim jutuldarcy --precompile
```

`init` writes `.jutul-agent/config.toml` and copies the simulator's Julia env
template. `--precompile` instantiates the env and warms the precompile caches
up front. The first time can take a while (Julia compiles the simulator and
the plotting stack), after which sessions start in seconds. Useful variants:

```sh
jutul-agent init --sim jutuldarcy --source-path /path/to/JutulDarcy.jl
jutul-agent init --sim jutuldarcy --force --precompile
```

`--source-path` dev-links the simulator to a local checkout the agent can read
and edit at its real path (a dev checkout, so it is writable, unlike a
registry install in the shared depot). `--force` rebuilds the env from the
template, the standard fix after upgrading jutul-agent. `setup` is an alias
for `init`. If you skip `init` entirely, the first run bootstraps the
workspace and auto-detects the simulator from a `Project.toml` when it can.

One simulator per workspace. Different simulators have incompatible Julia
dependencies, so use a separate folder for each. Pointing an existing
workspace at another simulator rebuilds the env from the new template on the
next run.

## Upgrading

jutul-agent is actively developed, so keep it current:

```sh
jutul-agent upgrade          # upgrade to the latest
jutul-agent upgrade --check  # just report the latest vs what's installed
```

`upgrade` does the right thing for how you installed: a tool install runs
`uv tool upgrade jutul-agent`; a dev checkout is told to `git pull && uv sync`.
On Windows the running executable can't replace itself, so the upgrade runs in
a new console window and jutul-agent exits to release the file; reopen it when
that window finishes.
At launch, jutul-agent also prints a one-line notice when a newer version is
available (a background check, cached for a day; it never delays startup). Turn
the notice off with `JUTUL_AGENT_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1`.

An upgrade ships new simulator env templates, but existing workspace envs are
only rebuilt from them on request. When a workspace's env was built from an
older template, launch (and `jutul-agent doctor`) say so; rebuild it with:

```sh
jutul-agent init --sim <name> --force --precompile
```

## Adding folders

Add folders outside the workspace so the agent can use them with the same
file tools:

```sh
jutul-agent tui --add-dir ../shared-data --add-dir ~/datasets/spe10
```

Inside the TUI, `/add-dir <path>` adds one immediately and `/add-dir` lists
the folders added so far. The agent uses each at its real absolute path in
every tool: the file tools, `run_julia`, and `execute`. Added folders last
for the session and are not written to config.

## Interfaces

Pick an interface explicitly — bare `jutul-agent` just lists them:

```sh
jutul-agent web      # browser UI: chat with interactive plots and reports (the usual way)
jutul-agent tui      # terminal UI
jutul-agent run "<prompt>"   # one headless turn, then exit
```

All three are the same agent and session core, so a session started in one
resumes in another. `jutul-agent web` is covered in
[the server interface](server-interface.md); the terminal UI and headless runs
are below.

## The TUI

```sh
jutul-agent tui
```

| Command | Effect |
|---|---|
| `/model` | Open the model selector (or `/model <provider:model>`) |
| `/approval-mode` | Set approval policy: `ask`, `workspace`, `auto` |
| `/add-dir <path>` | Add an extra folder |
| `/context` | Show context usage: tokens held vs the model's window |
| `/compact` | Summarize older turns to free context space |
| `/memory` | View workspace memory (`/memory edit` opens it in `$EDITOR`) |
| `/transcript` | Write the session transcript (add `md` for markdown) |
| `/copy` | Copy the last assistant message |
| `/clear` | Clear the visible log |
| `/help` | List commands |
| `/quit` | Exit |

| Key | Effect |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+C` | Interrupt the running turn. With text selected, copy. Twice when idle, exit |
| `Ctrl+G` | Cancel the in-flight turn (resets Julia if needed) |
| `Ctrl+O` | Toggle tool and reasoning cards between preview and full output |
| `Ctrl+L` | Clear the visible log |
| `Shift+Tab` | Cycle approval mode |
| `Ctrl+P` / `↑` | Previous history entry |

Approval modes: `ask` (default) prompts before shell commands and file edits,
`workspace` auto-allows file writes inside the workspace, `auto` allows all
side-effecting tools.

## Resuming a session

The conversation survives the process: every session checkpoints its
thread, so you can pick an earlier one back up.

```sh
jutul-agent tui --continue          # reopen the most recent session
jutul-agent tui --resume            # pick from a list of recent sessions
jutul-agent tui --resume 2026-06-12 # by id, or any unique prefix
jutul-agent sessions                # list what's resumable
```

(The web interface lists and resumes past sessions from its sidebar.)

A resumed TUI replays the prior exchanges and the model continues with the
full conversation. Sessions are named by start time plus a short suffix
(`2026-06-12-2315-3f2a`), so listings sort chronologically; the first
prompt also titles the session, and its output folder under
`jutul-agent-output/sessions/` carries that title as a slug.

One thing does not survive: the Julia REPL restarts with the process, so
variables and loaded packages from earlier turns are gone (files and
artifacts on disk remain). The agent is told this and re-runs setup it
needs.

## Headless turns

`jutul-agent run` takes a prompt, runs one turn, and exits:

```sh
jutul-agent run --approval-mode auto "Plot the voltage curve for the chen_2020 cell."
```

Headless mode cannot pause for approval, so use `--approval-mode auto` (the
run exits with an error if it would have needed to ask). `--ephemeral-memory`
gives the run a throwaway memory directory.

## Transcripts

Every session appends an event log to
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/jutul-agent/workspaces/<hash>/sessions/<id>/trace.sqlite`:
prompts, responses, every tool call with arguments and output, artifacts,
token usage. Render one:

```sh
jutul-agent transcript                   # last session, HTML
jutul-agent transcript <id>              # specific session
jutul-agent transcript --format markdown
jutul-agent transcript --bundle          # zip with artifacts included
```

## Models

Model ids are `provider:model` strings. Resolution precedence: `--model`
flag, workspace config, user config (`Ctrl+A` in the selector), the
`JUTUL_AGENT_MODEL` environment variable, then the default.

`/model` opens the selector: bundled OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Ollama
models, plus anything `init_chat_model` supports typed as `provider:model`.
Switching mid-session keeps the conversation. Missing API keys are prompted
for and saved to a user-global `.env` (never to config files).

### Local models (Ollama)

Pick an `ollama:` model in the selector. No key is needed. The list shows
recommended models, your installed ones, and Ollama Cloud models, and pulls
anything missing. Requirements and caveats:

- The model must support tool calling (`ollama show <model>` lists `tools`
  under Capabilities). Keep Ollama itself current: an outdated Ollama can
  fail to parse a new model's template and silently lose tool support.
- The agent's prompt is large. Local models load with a context window sized
  to what the model supports, capped by a memory budget (64K by default,
  lowered with `JUTUL_AGENT_OLLAMA_NUM_CTX` on tight hardware).

### Other providers

Add the provider's LangChain package to the tool install, then use its
`provider:model` id:

```sh
uv tool upgrade jutul-agent --with langchain-openrouter
```

(From a dev checkout, use `uv add langchain-openrouter` instead.) If the
package is missing, jutul-agent names the exact one to install.

## Troubleshooting

Start with the built-in check:

```sh
jutul-agent doctor
```

It verifies Julia is on PATH and 1.10+, the active model's key is set (or
Ollama is running for a local model), which Julia project the workspace
resolves to, that the simulator package is actually resolved in the env
manifest, that a display (or xvfb) is available for plotting, and that Julia
boots cleanly in the env. Each failure comes with a one-line fix.

Common cases:

- Workspace versus launch directory: the workspace is where you launch from,
  not where you ran `init`. `cd` there or pass `--workspace <path>`.
- A `Project.toml` at the workspace root takes precedence over
  `.jutul-agent/julia-env/`. If that root project lacks the simulator
  packages, `using <Sim>` fails even though Julia starts. `doctor` flags
  this.
- "Julia failed to start before the kernel was ready": the Julia subprocess
  crashed during startup. The message includes Julia's own error and the
  path to `julia-startup.log`. This is usually a stale env, rebuilt with
  `init --sim <name> --force --precompile`.
- Headless Linux without `xvfb`: simulation works, plotting errors. Install
  it (`sudo apt-get install -y xvfb`).
